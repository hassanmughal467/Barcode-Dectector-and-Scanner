# Barcode-Dectector-and-Scanner

1.The ZBar library will be used together with OpenCV to scan and decode barcodes and QR codes.

2.Once ZBar and OpenCV are properly configured weâ€™ll demonstrate how to scan barcodes and QR codes in a single image.

3.Starting with a single image will give us the practice we need to prepare for the next step: Reading barcodes and QR codes in real-time with OpenCV and ZBar.
